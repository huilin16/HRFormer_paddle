# HRFormer_paddle

An paddle implementation of  NeurIPS 2021 paper "HRFormer: High-Resolution Transformer for Dense Prediction".

This project is based on [PaddleClas](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleClas)


In this version, the shape of parameters in the torch model is aligned with that in the paddle model.
